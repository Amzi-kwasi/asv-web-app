    <h5 class="bluev">Understanding Networking Fundamentals</h5>
<p>In many cases,networking today has become a relatively simple plug-and-play process.Wireless card can automatically detect and join networks.Getting your network running may require a lot of configuration,and one messed-up setting can cause the whole thing to fail.The following sections cover the fundamentals.</p>

<h5 class="orange">LANs,WANs,PANs,and MANs.</h5>
<p><i class="green">Local area networks(LANs)</i> were introduced to connect computers in a single office or building.<i>Wide area networks(WANs)</i>expanded the LANs to include networks outside the local environment and also to distribute resources <mark>across great distances.</mark> Generally,its safe to think of a WAN as multiple,disbursed LANs connected together.Having two types of network categories just didn't feel like enough, so the industry introduced two more terms: the personal area network and the metropolitan area network. <p style="color:red;">The <i>personal area network(PAN)</i> is a very small-scale network designed around one person within a very limited boundary area.</p>
<h6 class="green">LANs</h6>
<p>A local area network (LAN) is a collection of devices connected together in one physical location, such as a building, office, or home. A LAN can be small or large, ranging from a home network with one user to an enterprise network with thousands of users and devices in an office or school.
</p>
<p>Regardless of size, a LAN's single defining characteristic is that it connects devices that are in a single, limited area. In contrast, a wide area network (WAN) or metropolitan area network (MAN) covers larger geographic areas. Some WANs and MANs connect many LANs together.
</p>
<img src="img/lans.jfif" style="width:50%;"><br><br>
<h6 class="green">WANs</h6>
<p>A wide area network (also known as WAN), is a large network of information that is not tied to a single location. WANs can facilitate communication, the sharing of information and much more between devices from around the world through a WAN provider.</p>
<p>
WANs can be vital for international businesses, but they are also essential for everyday use, as the internet is considered the largest WAN in the world. Keep reading for more information on WANs, their use, how they differ from other networks and their overall purpose for businesses and people, alike</p>
<img src="img/wans.jfif" style="width:50%;"><br><br>
<h5 class="orange">Primary Networks Components</h5>
<p>When you're looking at the devices or resources available on a network,there are three types of components of which you should be aware:</p><br>
<a href="#sv1">1. Servers</a><br>
<a href="#cl1">2. Clients or Workstations</a><br>
<a href="#re1">3.Resources</a>
<br><br>
<h6 class="green" id="sv1">Servers</h6>
<p>Servers comes in many shapes and sizes.They are a core component of the network, providing a link to the resources necessary to perform any task.The link that the server provides could be to a resource existing on the server itself or a resource o n a client computer. Servers offers networks the capability of centralizing the control of resources and security,thereby reducing administrative difficulties.</p>
<p>Servers can perform several different critical roles on a network. For example,server that provide files to the users on the network are called <i style="color:red;">file servers.</i></p>
<h6 class="green" id="cl1">Clients/Workstations</h6>
<p>They are computers on which the network users do their work, performing activities such as word processing, database design.email,and other office / personal tasks. As clients they are allowed to communicate with the servers in the network to use the network's resources</p>
<h6 class="green" id="re1">Network Resources</h6>
<p>We now have the server to share the resources and the workstation to use them, but what about the resources themselves? A <i style="color:brown"> resource</i> (as far as the network is concerned) ia any item that can be used on a network. Resources can include a broad range of items,but the following items are among the most important:</p>
<i>!. Printers and other peripherals</i><br>
<i>2.Disk storage and the file access</i><br>
<i>3.Applications</i>
<p>Networks also give users more storage space to store their files. Client computers can't always handle the overhead involved in storing large files(for example,database files) because they are already heavily involved in users' day-to-day work activities. Because servers in a network can be dedicated to only certain functions, a server can be allocated to store all of the larger files that used every day, freeing up disk space on client computers.</p>
<p>Files that all users need to access (such as emergency contact lists and company policies) can also be stored on a server. Applications (programs) no longer need to be on every computer in the office.If the server is capable of handling the overhead that an application requires, the application can reside on the server.</p>
<h5 class="red">Peer-Peer Networks</h5>
<p>In peer-to-peer network,the computers act as both service providers and service requestors.</p><img src="img/peer.png" style="width:50%;"><i>Peer-to-peer resource model</i>
<p>The peer-to-peer model is great for small,simple, inexpensive networks. Peer-to-peer resource models are generally considered the right choice for small companies that didn't expect future growth.</p>
<h6 class="red">Client-Server Resource Model</h6>
<p>Client-server(also known as server-based) model is better than the peer-to-peer model for large networks that need a more secure environment and centralised control. Server-based networks use one or more dedicated, centralised servers. All administrative functions and resources sharing are performed from this point.</p><img src="img/client.jpg" width="60%"><i>Client-server resource model</i>
<p>Server-based networks are often known as <i style="color:blue">domains.</i> Client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.[1] Often clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may reside in the same system. A server host runs one or more server programs, which share their resources with clients. A client usually does not share any of its resources, but it requests content or service from a server. Clients, therefore, initiate communication sessions with servers, which await incoming requests. Examples of computer applications that use the client-server model are email, network printing, and the World Wide Web.</p>




<h5 class="bluev">Network Topologies</h5>
<p>A topology is the arrangement/structure or the way of laying out the networks</p>
<p>There are five primary topologies:</p>
<a href="#r9">Bus</a><br><a href="#y87">Star</a><br><a href="#d7">Ring</a><br>
<a href="#d6">Mesh</a><br><a href="#d5">Hybrid</a>
<h6 class="green"  id="r9">Bus topology</h6>
<p>A bus topology is the simplest. It consist of a single cable that runs to every workstation. This topology uses the least amount of cabling. With a bus topology,messages pass through the trunk, and each workstation checks to see if a message is addressed to it.</p>
<img src="img/bus.png" class="img"><i>Bus topology</i>
<p>Cable systems that use the bus topology are easy to install. Although the bus topology uses the least amount of cabling, it is difficult to add a workstation.</p>
</p>
<h6 class="green" id="y87">Star Topology</h6>
<p>A star topology branches each network device called a <i style="color:red">hub or a switch,</i>making it easy to add a new workstation. If a workstation goes down, It does not affect the entire network. Because of this the hub (or switch) is called <i style="color:orange;">single point of failure.</i></p><img src="img/stare.png" style="width:50%;">
<p>Star topology are easy in tall. A cable is run from each workstation to the hub. Star topologies are more expensive to install than bus networks because several cables need to be installed, plus the hubs.</p>
<h6 class="green" id="d7">Ring Topology</h6>
<p>In a ring topology, each computer connects to two other computers, joining them in a circle and creating a unidirectional path where messages move from workstation to workstation. A ring makes it difficult to add new computers. Unlike the star topology network,the ring topology network will go down if one entity is removed from the ring.</p><img src="img/ring.jpg" style="width:50%;"><i>Ring topology</i>
<h6 class="green"  id="d6">Mesh Topology</h6>
<p> The mesh topology is the most complex in terms of physical design. In this topology, each device is connected to every other device. If there are x computers,there will be <i style="color:green">(x times (x-1))/ 2 cables in the network.</i>For example, if you have five computers in a mesh network, it will use 5 times(5-1) divided by 2 = 10 cables. Because of its design, the physical mesh topology is expensive to install and maintain.</p>
<img src="img/mesh.png" style="width:50%;"><i>Mesh topology</i>
 <p> Cables must run from each device to every other device. With mesh topology, there will always be a way to get the data from source to destination.</p>
 <h6 class="green" id="d5">Hybrid Topology</h6>
 <p>The hybrid topology is simply a mix of the other topologies. The hybrid gives a combination of the best features of each topology used. In fact, most networks today are not only hybrid but heterogeneous (they include a mix of components of different types and brands). The hybrid network is complex(less so than mesh). They may be more expensive than some types of network topologies, but it takes the best features of all of the other topologies and exploits them.</p>
