<h5 class="h5s">Troubleshooting Systems</h5> 
<h6 class="h5s" d1>Troubleshooting Keyboard Problem </h6>
<p>If you are having an issue with a keyboard, try the following</p> 
<p>1. Was any liquid spilled on the keyboard? If so, you may have to replace the keyboard.</p> 
<p>2. A key could be stuck. Unplug it from the computer and press every key on the keyboard to see if it gets unstuck. Also sometimes an object can get under a key and this should fix that issue.</p> 
<p>3. When you type the letters are not moved over but instead are replaced.</p>  
<p>4. Set the BIOS to default and clear NVRAM</p>  
<p>5. If the keyboard is USB, make sure the USB features in the BIOS is enabled.</p> 
<p>6. Make sure the keyboard is plugged into the correct port. Today most PS2 ports are color coded (not all systems though). Purple is keyboard and Green is mouse. Some systems will not allow the keyboard to be plugged into the mouse port and some systems will allow you to plug the keyboard in the mouse port. If you have it in the mouse port and the keyboard is not working, that could be the cause.</p> 
<p>7. If you do have it in the correct port, swap ports with the mouse. If your system will allow the ports to be swapped, you can see if the mouse works in the keyboard port and if the keyboard works in the mouse port. If they do then the motherboard is bad.</p> 
<p>8. Try the keyboard on another system. If it works there then the problem is somewhere on the system. If the problem occurs there than the keyboard is bad.</p> 
<p>9. Try the keyboard in DOS. If it occurs in DOS than the issue is in Windows and it is a software issue.</p> 
<p>10. Install the latest driver for the keyboard. Go to the website of the keyboard and see if there is a driver for it.</p> 
<p>11. Check the settings of the keyboard in control panel Go to control panel (This link will open in a different window)</p> 
<p>12. If you are using a program for your keyboard (such as touchpad software), Uninstall it and see if the default keyboard driver works fine. If it does work ok with it uninstalled, reinstall the software and see if the problem comes back. If it does, then there is either a problem with the software or a setting needs to be changed in the software. </p>
<p>13. If you cannot wake the system up with the keyboard, the issue may be a setting  </p>
<p>14. Try the keyboard without the PCI cards. </p>
<p>15. If the keyboard works, then put one PCI card in till the problem comes back.</p> 
<p>16. If the problem you are having is the wrong character appears, click here for help with this issue.</p>  
<p>17. If you are still unable to figure out the cause of your keyboard problems try a different hard drive.</p> 
<p>18. Try the Software Troubleshooter</p>
<p>19. If you are still having the issue and you have ruled out the keyboard as the cause, then the cause is either hard drive or motherboard. If you have reinstalled your operating system or tried another hard drive then the issue is with your motherboard and it will need to be replaced.</p>
<h5 class="h5s" id="d2">Sound Problem</h5> 
<p>To troubleshoot a no sound issue, follow the following steps</p>  
<p>1. Check Device Manager for any bangs</p>  
<p>2. Check to make sure volume is not muted and the volume is up.</p> 
<p>3. Make sure your speakers are connected correctly. (sometimes people will mistaken the wrong connector on the sound card and this can cause no sound)</p> 
<p>4. Make sure the speakers are turned on and the volume is up. </p> 
<p>5. Try the speakers on a stereo to see if they work or try another set of speakers. (Do not try the headphone jack on the CD-ROM. Their is some computers that the headphone jack doesn't work on).</p>  
<p>6. Make sure sound is selected in sound and multimedia</p>  
<p>7. If you have no sound icon by the clock, click here for help with this issue.</p> 
<p>8. Try limiting MSCONFIG</p>  
<p>9. You can try doing a System Restore </p> 
<p>10. Remove Multimedia from Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel</p>  
<p>11. Go to sound Icon in Control panel and remove Audio Codecs.</p> 
<p>12. Remove sound from Add/Remove Programs</p> 
<p>13. Make sure sound devices are deleted in Device manager. If they are there then delete them. </p> 
<p>14. Boot to Safe mode</p> 
<p>15. When youâ€™re in Safe Mode, see if there is any Ghost drivers in Device manager. (If there is, try to delete them. It may or may not let you delete them.)</p>   
<p>16. Boot to the BIOS. Try setting BIOS to default and clear NVRAM. Click here for info on setting the BIOS. </p> 
 
<p>17. Some motherboards will let you set it to Maintenance Mode. Please consult your manual or manufacturer on assistance on that procedure.  </p>
<p>18. Reinstall sound card drivers.</p>  
<p>19. Reseat the sound card in the computer.</p>   
<p>20. Try a modem or another PCI card you know works in the slot that the sound card was in.</p>  
<p>21. Try removing all<a href="techterms.html#pci">PCI</a> cards except for the sound card. Sometimes another<a href="techterms.html#pci"> PCI</a> card can conflict with another card.</p>  
<p>22. If you have another system with a sound card, you can try that sound card on this system and try this sound card with that system. </p> 
<p>23. If you have a CD that has Diagnostics on it (most manufacturers have diags on their disk. Contact the manufacturer for information on running the diags.) If you have sound running diags in DOS, your sound card works and it is  a software issue.</p>  
<p>24. Use Software Troubleshooter to troubleshoot your system. </p>
<p>25. If you have verified that all hardware is working, then it is a software issue. Try running a repair of Windows. (Click the operating system for instructions) NOTE: This can harm your data. Safe any files you don't want to loose before following this step!  Windows XP</p>  
<p>26. If you are still having trouble with the sound, you may want to contact the computer manufacturer or the manufacturer of the sound card. They have more information on the system or sound card than I would.</p>  
<p>27. If you have tried everything and still have no sound, you may want to save your personal files and do a reinstall of the operating system. Click the links for instructions on reinstalling the OS.  Reinstall OS </p>

<p>4. Turn printer back on</p> 
<p>5. Wait one minute </p>
<p>6. Make sure all connections are good</p> 
<p>7. If your printer has both parallel and USB connectors, only have one of the two connected and not both. The USB is faster.  (most new systems do not have parallel connections) </p>
<p>8. Turn computer back on </p>
<p>9. Make sure the printer has ink </p>
<p>10. Is the printer networked? If so is it connected to the network via computer or router. If it is connected via a computer and the computer is off, the other systems will not see it. </p> 
<p>11. Make sure the dependencies to the print spool is started </p> 
<p>12. Check the manufacturer of the printer to see if there is a newer driver for the printer.</p> 
<p>13. Check the manufacturer for any patches or issues with the printer </p>
<p>14. "Spooler subsystem app has encountered a problem and needs to close" and "Operation could not be completed" error messages Click here for help with this.</p> 
<p>15. Check Device Manager for bangs.  (A bang is a !, X or ? next to the device. The !, X or ? indicates an issue)</p> 
<p>16. Boot to Safe mode and check for bangs in Device Manager.</p>  
<p>17. Limit MSCONFIG and check for a virus. (Windows 98, ME, and Windows XP) (Be sure to return MSCONFIG to original state after troubleshooting unless you want to leave it that way) </p>
